 IoT Based Home Security Status Monitoring System Using Blynk
ABSTRACT:

      Door Security plays a vital role in home security. To secure the house, the occupants of the house will always have the door locked. However, sometimes the house occupants forget to lock the door due to hurry when leaving the house, or they may doubt whether they have locked the door or not. We propose an application called Door Security System which is based on Android using Internet of Things (IoT) technology to monitor the status of the door, controlling the door, and increasing security in a house.
           This project aims to solve the most widespread problem that everyone faces. That is the security of our homes. Nowadays thieves can easily break into houses without anyone noticing them. And, when we are away, we cannot immediately know if anyone broke into our house/garage we can notice their actions quick enough so that we can notify the appropriate authorities about the burglars faster.
           This system works by monitoring the activity of the main door or windows as soon as the system detects that the door is opened or being tampered with, the user instantly gets a notification on his/her phone through the Blynk App notifying that the door has been opened so that we can act very swiftly to the situation. This not only prevents burglars but is also very efficient and low-cost design which can be implemented anywhere like homes, offices, garages etc.
            This ensures that maximum security is imposed so that the burglars are caught or the owner of the house gets notified the second the doors or windows of their house are opened. This is also useful for any offices, shops, garages. This is a very extremely simple solution to a major problem also this is a very low-cost solution that anyone can implement.
